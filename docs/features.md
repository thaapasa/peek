## Operating Modes

### Viewer Mode ◐

Full-screen interactive console view. User exits manually (`q` / `Esc`). Keyboard interaction for
toggling options, scrolling, searching, and switching between views.

Works for all file types via the mode-stack architecture: text/source/structured `ContentMode`,
`ImageRenderMode` for raster + rasterized SVG, `AnimationMode` for GIF/WebP, plus universal
`HexMode` / `InfoMode` / `HelpMode` / `AboutMode`. Scrolling; Tab cycles the file's view modes
(content / image / SVG-source / Info — Hex, About, and Help are kept on dedicated keys); `i` jumps
straight to Info; hex (`x`); help (`h`/`?`); about (`a`); live theme cycle (`t`); color-encoding
cycle (`c`); `r` toggles raw/pretty inside the structured-data viewer. Image-specific: `b` cycles
background, `m` cycles
render mode. Animation: `p` play/pause, `n`/`N` and Left/Right step frames. `l` toggles the
line-number gutter in text views. Search not yet.

### Print Mode ◐

Direct stdout, no interactivity (`cat`-like). Default output by file type:

- **Text / source code** — syntax-highlighted (unless `--plain`)
- **Structured data** — pretty-printed + highlighted; `--raw` emits verbatim source (still
  highlighted unless `--plain`)
- **Images** — ASCII art at contain ratio
- **SVG** — rendered preview (ASCII art)
- **Binary / unknown** — hex dump (streaming, `hexdump -C` layout, terminal-width aware)

Active when `--print` / `-p` is set or stdout isn't a TTY.

### Mode Selection ◐

- `--viewer` / `-v` forces viewer.
- `--print` / `-p` forces print.
- **Default:** if output exceeds the console size, viewer; else print.
- **Binary / unknown** files default to printing file info and exiting; `--viewer` forces the
  interactive viewer.
- All data types should support both modes where it makes sense.

TTY detection and `--print` / `-p` work. Binary files default to the hex-dump viewer (interactive in
TTY, streamed for pipes); `--plain` / `-P` still uses hex for binary (plain text would corrupt
non-UTF-8 bytes). No content-length-based auto-selection yet (currently TTY → viewer, non-TTY →
print).

### Input ✅

peek is a single-file viewer: at most one positional argument. Stdin: pass `-` explicitly, or pipe
with no file argument. Stdin is auto-detected by magic bytes (images, binary) and content sniffing (
JSON, YAML, XML/SVG); plain text falls back to `--language` for syntax highlighting.

To view several files, run peek once per file. No `cat`-style batch — concatenating images,
structured data, and binary into one stream rarely produces useful output.

| Scenario         | Stdin is TTY                     | Stdin is piped            |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `peek` (no args) | Show short help                  | Read stdin, render        |
| `peek -`         | Read stdin (blocks until Ctrl-D) | Read stdin, render        |
| `peek file.rs`   | View file normally               | View file (stdin ignored) |

After consuming piped stdin, peek reopens fd 0 from the controlling terminal (resolved via
`ttyname()` to the real device path, not `/dev/tty`, since macOS kqueue can't register the latter)
so the interactive viewer's keyboard input still works.

Implemented for all viewers — text, source code, structured data, raster images (PNG/JPEG/WebP/…),
animated images (GIF/WebP), and SVG.

## Supported File Types

Not exhaustive — additions over time.

### Source Code ✅

All standard languages supported by syntect with `two-face`/bat extended definitions. Covers 100+
languages including Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, Ruby, Shell, TOML,
Dockerfile.

Features: syntax-colored source with theme support; toggleable line numbers (✅, `--line-numbers` /
`-n` / `l`).

### Structured Data / Config Files

| Format | Extensions      | Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| JSON   | `.json`         | ✅      |
| JSONC  | `.jsonc`        | ☐      |
| JSON5  | `.json5`        | ☐      |
| YAML   | `.yaml`, `.yml` | ✅      |
| TOML   | `.toml`         | ✅      |
| XML    | `.xml`          | ✅      |
| HTML   | `.html`, `.htm` | ✅      |
| CSV    | `.csv`, `.tsv`  | ☐      |

Pending entries (JSONC, JSON5, HTML rendered view, CSV/TSV) live in
[planned.md](planned.md#structured-data-additions-).

Two viewing sub-modes (toggle with `r`; CLI `--raw`):

- **Pretty** (default) — reformatted with syntax highlighting
- **Raw** — verbatim source with syntax highlighting only

`--plain` / `-P` disables all styling.

### Image Files ✅

Raster formats rendered as ASCII art. Supported via the `image` crate:

| Format  | Extensions             |
|---------|------------------------|
| PNG     | `.png`                 |
| JPEG    | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`        |
| GIF     | `.gif`                 |
| BMP     | `.bmp`                 |
| WebP    | `.webp`                |
| TIFF    | `.tiff`, `.tif`        |
| ICO     | `.ico`                 |
| AVIF    | `.avif`                |
| PNM     | `.pnm`, `.pbm`, `.pgm` |
| TGA     | `.tga`                 |
| OpenEXR | `.exr`                 |
| QOI     | `.qoi`                 |
| DDS     | `.dds`                 |

Five ASCII-art rendering modes (cyclable with `m`; CLI `--image-mode`):

| Mode      | Description                                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `full`    | All glyphs (block, quadrant, extended)                                        |
| `block`   | Block / quadrant elements + ASCII subset                                      |
| `geo`     | Block / quadrant elements + line segments only                                |
| `ascii`   | Legacy luminance-based density ramp                                           |
| `contour` | Sobel edge detection rendered as line-art (`--edge-density` tunes line count) |

In viewer mode, Tab cycles the file's view modes (image → file info for raster; image → SVG source
→ file info for SVG). 24-bit truecolor; status line shows the active mode.

#### SVG ✅

SVG (`.svg`) is vector; the `image` crate doesn't handle it. Rasterized via `resvg`.

Two viewing modes (cycle with Tab):

- **Rendered preview** (default) — rasterize, render through the image pipeline
- **Source view** — syntax-highlighted XML (pretty or raw)

Re-renders on terminal resize.

##### SVG Animation ◐

CSS `@keyframes` animation is supported (`viewer/image/svg_anim.rs`). The parser collects each
`@keyframes` rule plus inline-style `animation-*` references on elements, builds a merged frame
timeline (one frame per stop for `steps()` timing, ~30 fps interpolated for `linear`), and
`SvgAnimationMode` rasterizes each frame on demand from a per-frame patched SVG. A bounded LRU (64
entries, keyed by `(frame, grid_cols, grid_rows)`) makes a full second loop free.

Phase 1 covers what termsvg / asciinema-svg-style files use: `transform: translateX/Y/translate`
under `steps()` or `linear` timing, inline-style targets only. SMIL (`<animate>`,
`<animateMotion>`) and class/id-selector targets are deferred. `--no-svg-anim` forces the static
render. The Info panel reports frame count, total duration, and looping vs one-shot.

#### Transparency Handling ◐

Images with transparency (PNG, SVG, WebP, GIF) need a compositing background before ASCII rendering.
Without one, transparent regions default to black, making dark content invisible against dark
terminal backgrounds.

| Background     | Description                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `none`         | No compositing — transparent regions render as-is |
| `black`        | Solid black                                       |
| `white`        | Solid white                                       |
| `checkerboard` | Classic Photoshop-style pattern                   |

Auto-detection: dark content → white bg, light content → black bg. `--background` flag and `b` key
cycling work. Checkerboard uses 8×8 pixel gray. Compositing is always applied when an alpha channel
is present (no per-image opt-out).

#### Image Sizing Modes ◐

| Mode        | Behavior                                                              |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Contain`   | Fit within both width and height — whole image always shown (default) |
| `FitWidth`  | Width fills the terminal; height grows freely → vertical scroll       |
| `FitHeight` | Height fills the terminal; width grows freely → horizontal scroll     |

Cycle interactively with `f` (image / SVG render views). Pipe / `--print`
output always uses `Contain` (rows are unbounded, so the other modes are
either nonsensical or reduce to `Contain`). The image is never rotated;
only the constraining axis changes.

Scroll keys in image views:

- `Up` / `Down` / `PgUp` / `PgDn` — vertical scroll under `FitWidth`
- `Left` / `Right` — horizontal scroll under `FitHeight`
- `Home` — return to top-left; `End` — jump to bottom

Toggling fit mode resets the scroll offset (the old position has no
meaning in the new grid). No `--sizing` CLI flag yet.

### Animated Images (GIF, WebP) ✅

Auto-plays at native frame rate. `p` toggles play/pause; `n`/`N` and Left/Right step frames; `b`
cycles background. Status line shows frame counter and play/pause. Print mode renders the first
frame. Frame count appears in the file info screen. Transparency handling applies.

### Binary and Archive Files ◐

For files peek doesn't have a specialized viewer for — ISOs, DMGs, executables — the baseline
shows the **file info screen**:

- File type / MIME (detected via magic bytes through the `infer` crate)
- Size (exact + human-readable)
- Filesystem metadata (permissions, timestamps)

`infer` provides MIME only (e.g. `application/x-iso9660-image`, `application/x-apple-diskimage`) —
no deeper metadata. Format-specific details (ISO volume label, partition table, executable
architecture) could be added later with dedicated parsers.

Binary files open in the hex-dump viewer by default (`hexdump -C`-style, terminal-width aware,
streaming via `ByteSource`). File info reachable via Tab / `i` from within hex, and via `--info`.
`--plain` / `-P` still uses hex for binary. No format-specific deep metadata yet.

#### Archive Listing ◐

Container archives open in a **TOC view** — one row per entry with permissions, uncompressed
size, mtime, and path. No payload extraction; only the per-entry headers are read. Tab cycles
TOC ↔ Info; `x` still drops into the raw hex dump of the archive bytes.

| Format      | Extensions                     | Status |
|-------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| ZIP         | `.zip`, `.jar`, `.war`, `.apk` | ✅      |
| Tar         | `.tar`                         | ✅      |
| Tar + gzip  | `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`              | ✅      |
| Tar + bzip2 / xz / zstd, 7-Zip, RAR |                  | ☐ planned |

Info view shows entry / file / directory counts and total uncompressed size. Listing failures
(corrupt archive, unsupported variant) surface as a warning row and the TOC view is empty.

#### Hex Dump Mode ✅

Reads bytes from disk on demand (no full-file slurp). Layout: `hexdump -C`-compatible — 8-digit
offset, two hex columns of N/2 bytes separated by an extra space, then a printable-ASCII column
between `|`s. Bytes-per-row scales with terminal width: `14 + 4*bpr` columns (rounded down to a
multiple of 8, minimum 8). Pipe mode honors `$COLUMNS` (≥ 24) or falls back to 16.

Reachable from any view with `x`. The viewer maintains a logical `Position` (byte offset or line
index) captured on switch-out from any position-tracking mode and restored on switch-in. Entering
hex from a text view positions the top at the byte offset corresponding to the current line (via
`InputSource::line_to_byte`, approximate for pretty-printed content); returning to text re-aligns
the line scroll. Modes that don't track position (Info, Help, Image preview, Animation) leave the
saved position untouched, so detours preserve where you were.

Pressing `x` again returns to the user's last primary mode (most recent non-aux), regardless of
intervening detours. When hex is the default for a binary file, no primary exists — `x` is a no-op
there.

## Viewer Features

### Color Modes ✅

`--color` / `-C`, or `PEEK_COLOR`. Five modes:

| Mode        | Encoding                                      |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `truecolor` | 24-bit RGB (`\x1b[38;2;r;g;bm`) — default     |
| `256`       | xterm 256-color palette (`\x1b[38;5;Nm`)      |
| `16`        | 16 base ANSI colors (`\x1b[3Nm` / `\x1b[9Nm`) |
| `grayscale` | 24-bit luminance only — preserves shading     |
| `plain`     | no escapes — strip all color from the output  |

`c` cycles modes interactively; the rendered-lines cache invalidates on each cycle so the whole UI
repaints in the new encoding.

All callers paint truecolor RGB; the `ColorMode` enum on `PeekTheme` owns the conversion and is the
single point where the encoding is decided. Image rendering routes the same way via
`ColorMode::write_fg` / `write_fg_bg`. Plain mode emits text content with zero ANSI escapes (no SGR
resets), so piped output is safe to compose with other tools.

### File Info Screen ✅

Reachable via Tab (cycle content / info) or `i` (jump to info). Available for every file type via
`--info` and Tab/`i` interactively. Semantic coloring throughout (age-based timestamps, size-based
colors, per-character permission coloring).

- **General** — file name, size (exact + human-readable, e.g. `59,521,024 bytes (56.74 MiB)`), MIME,
  permissions, timestamps
- **Images** — dimensions, megapixels, color mode, bit depth, ICC profile, HDR detection, animation
  stats, EXIF, XMP
- **Documents/text** — line/word/char counts, blank lines, longest line, line endings, indent style,
  encoding, shebang
- **Structured data** — top-level kind, key/element count, max nesting depth, total node count, XML
  root + namespaces
- **SVG** — viewBox, declared dimensions, element counts (paths, groups, rects, circles, text),
  script / external-href flags, plus source text stats
- **Binary** — detected format from magic (Mach-O, ELF, PE, ZIP, SQLite, …)

EXIF: camera make/model, lens, orientation, resolution/DPI, exposure, aperture, ISO, focal length,
flash, white balance, date taken, GPS, artist, copyright. ICC profile name parsed from the embedded
profile's `desc` / `mluc` tag. Animation stats (frame count, total duration, average FPS, loop
count) come from header-walking GIF chunks and parsing WebP RIFF ANIM/ANMF chunks. XMP metadata
scraped from head bytes for Dublin Core / XMP fields (title, subject, description, creator, rights,
rating, label). Structured-data stats from a parse pass. Text stats from a single streaming pass
that also detects BOM-based encoding. HDR detection scans for Ultra HDR gain map markers.

### Line Numbers ✅

Toggleable line numbers for text-based views (ContentMode: source, structured raw/pretty, plain
text, SVG XML). Off by default; `--line-numbers` / `-n` enables at startup, `l` toggles in the
viewer. Gutter is right-aligned with a minimum width of 2 digits and painted in the theme's gutter
color. In pretty mode the numbers count visible pretty-printed lines (the lines actually shown), not
source byte lines.

### Line Wrapping ✅

Soft wrap on by default for ContentMode (text, source, structured pretty/raw, SVG XML). Each
visible logical line is sliced into visual rows of width `term_cols - gutter_width` via
`wrap_styled`, so the row budget accounts for wrapped continuations and the status line never
scrolls out of view.

Toggle with `w`. Vertical scroll (`j`/`k`, PgUp/PgDn, Home/End) moves one **visual row** at a time
when wrap is on — long lines no longer make a single keypress jump over all their wrapped rows.
The line-number gutter shows the real (logical) line number on the first segment; continuation
rows have a blank gutter of the same width so wrapped content aligns under its first row.

Status bar shows `Wrap` only when wrap is on (default-on convention; absence means "off").

### Horizontal Scrolling ✅

Companion to wrap-off mode: `Left` / `Right` pan the viewport horizontally by 8 columns per
press (`less -S` feel). Active only when wrap is off — wrap-on makes Left/Right inert because
content is already fully visible. The gutter does not pan; it stays anchored to the left edge.

### Help Screen ◐

`h` / `?` opens the help screen. Shows keyboard shortcuts and the active theme. Shortcut list is
composed per file type from the union of global actions and each loaded mode's extras — so an SVG
file's help shows the background-cycle shortcut, while a JSON file's doesn't. Per-active-mode
filtering (showing only the active mode's extras) not yet done.

### About Screen ✅

`a` shows the gradient peek logo, version, tagline, the active theme's full palette as colored
swatches, and a short list of pointers (homepage, license, common keys). Doubles as a theme
showcase — cycling themes with `t` while on About previews how each theme paints the full palette.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| `m`              | Cycle render mode                               |

`Left` / `Right` are pan keys in both static and animated image views — frame stepping uses
`n` / `N` exclusively (the previous Left/Right frame-step bindings are gone).

These bindings are initial suggestions and may be revised. The help screen (`h`) is the
authoritative in-app reference.

## Color and Rendering

### Theme Selection ✅

`--theme` / `PEEK_THEME`. Default `idea-dark`. Four custom embedded `.tmTheme` themes:

- **idea-dark** — JetBrains IDEA default Dark (default)
- **vscode-dark-modern** — VS Code Dark Modern
- **vscode-dark-2026** — VS Code Dark 2026
- **vscode-monokai** — VS Code Monokai

`t` cycles themes live in the interactive viewer.

### Theme Architecture ✅

Syntect themes provide colors for syntax highlighting scopes (keywords, strings, comments) and ~30
editor UI color slots (foreground, background, selection, gutter, find highlight, accent). peek
needs colored output beyond syntax highlighting — file info screens, help text, `--help`, status
indicators, line-number gutters, search highlights, and other UI all need consistent theming.

`PeekTheme` defines semantic color roles:

| Role           | Purpose                                | Derived from (syntect)               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `foreground`   | Default text color                     | `settings.foreground`                |
| `background`   | View background                        | `settings.background`                |
| `heading`      | Section headings, titles               | scope `keyword` or `accent`          |
| `label`        | Field names, option names              | scope `entity.name`                  |
| `value`        | Field values, literals                 | scope `string`                       |
| `accent`       | Emphasis, highlights                   | `settings.accent` or scope `keyword` |
| `muted`        | Secondary text, comments, descriptions | scope `comment`                      |
| `warning`      | File size warnings, errors             | scope `invalid` or red               |
| `gutter`       | Line numbers                           | `settings.gutter_foreground`         |
| `search_match` | Search result highlighting             | `settings.find_highlight`            |
| `selection`    | Selected / active item                 | `settings.selection`                 |

Layers:

1. **Syntect theme** — loaded from custom embedded `.tmTheme` files. Provides syntax scope colors
   and editor UI slots.
2. **peek theme roles** — derived automatically from the syntect theme. Semantic colors for all
   non-syntax UI output.
3. **All colored text output** routes through a common rendering layer: syntect (syntax-highlighted
   code) or peek roles (everything else).
4. **Override support** — custom peek themes could override individual roles if the auto-derived
   mapping doesn't look right for a particular syntect theme. Format and mechanism TBD.

Also serves as the integration point for color compatibility modes — the rendering layer can
downgrade colors from 24-bit to 256/16/none.

`PeekTheme` derives the roles from the active syntect theme. All non-syntax UI (info screens, help,
`--help`) uses these via `PeekTheme::paint()`. `.tmTheme` files embedded at compile time via
`include_str!`. The gutter role drives the line-number column in ContentMode; the search-highlight
role is defined but unused (search not implemented yet).

### Compatibility Modes ◐

Two rendering axes:

| Axis      | Modes                                                                  | Status                                                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Color     | truecolor, 256, 16, grayscale, plain                                   | ✅ (see [Color Modes](#color-modes-))                                    |
| Character | Full Unicode, ASCII-only (image rendering only — `--image-mode ascii`) | ◐ image side done; UI/glyph fallback for non-Unicode terminals not done |

Color is handled by `ColorMode` — all callers paint truecolor RGB and the active mode decides the
wire form. Image rendering routes through the same point via `ColorMode::write_fg` / `write_fg_bg`.
Character compatibility is partial: `--image-mode ascii` falls back to a luminance density ramp for
terminals without block/quadrant glyphs, but the rest of the UI (status line, info screen) still
uses Unicode box-drawing and dashes.

For library-produced output (syntect), `viewer::ranges_to_escaped` replaces syntect's hardcoded
24-bit `as_24_bit_terminal_escaped` with one routed through `ColorMode::fg_seq`, so
syntax-highlighted code is downgraded along with everything else.

`--plain` and `--raw` are orthogonal. `--raw` preserves original file structure (no pretty-printing)
but still applies colors and font styles. `--plain` disables all console enhancements (colors, bold,
italic) but doesn't change structure. Combinable: `--plain --raw` gives completely unmodified
content with no styling.

`--print` / `-p` forces print mode. `--plain` / `-P` disables syntax highlighting and
pretty-printing.

### `--help` Screen ✅

`-h` (short) and `--help` (long) produce two custom-themed screens — not the default clap output.

- **`-h` (concise)** — gradient logo, version + tagline, usage line, common options. The 90% case
  without the wall of options.
- **`--help` (full)** — everything in `-h`, plus rarely-used options (theme, color, language, width,
  image-mode, background, margin, utc) and the full theme listing with the active marker.

Both share the gradient-painted logo (small-slant style):

```
                 __  
   ___  ___ ___ / /__
  / _ \/ -_) -_)  '_/
 / .__/\__/\__/_/\_\ 
/_/                  
```

Entire output styled with the active theme — headings, option names, descriptions.
`--help --theme <name>` works as a theme preview / showcase.

### `--version` ✅

`--version` / `-V` prints a single line: `peek X.Y.Z`. Unstyled, suitable for shell scripts (
`peek --version | awk ...`). Themed logo banner is intentionally omitted — for a styled banner with
version info, use `-h` / `--help` or the `a` view in the interactive viewer.

## Distribution ✅

Release artifacts (prebuilt binaries) on GitHub Releases for macOS (`aarch64`, `x86_64`), Linux (
`aarch64`, `x86_64`), and Windows (`x86_64`). POSIX `install.sh` at the repo root fetches the right
archive, verifies SHA256, installs to `$HOME/.local/bin` (or `$PEEK_INSTALL_DIR`). Windows users
download the `.zip` manually. Releases are cut by dispatching `.github/workflows/release.yml`; the
workflow reads the version from `Cargo.toml`, refuses to run if `vX.Y.Z` already exists on `origin`,
and creates+pushes the tag itself.
